    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It hides the internal details of how the data and methods are implemented, exposing only a well-defined interface to the outside world. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and abstraction, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by providing a clear and concise representation of the essential features. It allows you to focus on the relevant details while ignoring unnecessary complexities. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define the structure and behavior of objects without providing the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). The subclass can extend and specialize the functionality of the superclass, reusing and customizing its features. Inheritance allows for code reuse, promotes the \"is-a\" relationship, and facilitates the creation of hierarchical class structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows a single interface (method or operator) to represent different behaviors based on the context or the types of objects it interacts with. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). Polymorphism simplifies code design and promotes flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars provide a solid foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems, enabling the modeling of real-world entities and their interactions in a structured, reusable, and maintainable manner."
